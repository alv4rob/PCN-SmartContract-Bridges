# Example Cases
This directory groups several cases where the tools have been applied. Each case is organized into one of the directories, all of which share a common structure consisting of three subdirectories:
* ***src***: Contains the **original PCN model** used as the starting point.
* ***sce-gen***: Contains the **smart contract** (SmaC model) **generated** by the PCN-Smart contract bridge based on the original PCN model.
* ***pcn-gen***: Contains the **PCN model generated** by the smart contract-PCN bridge based on the generated smart contract.

To facilitate navigation, the following table summarizes the content of all cases:

| Original PCN | Description | Generated Smart Contract | Generated PCN |
